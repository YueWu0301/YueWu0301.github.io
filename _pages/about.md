I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Statistcs and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jing](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=jingby&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) from [School of Statistcs and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), Southern University of Science and Technology. **Pursuing a PhD in the field of Artificial Intelligence ~** 


During my undergraduate studies, I extensively studied computer science, mathematics, and statistics, including data structures and algorithm analysis, convex optimization analysis, statistical learning, and mathematical statistics. I have a solid theoretical foundation in mathematics and statistics and strong learning abilities. Additionally, I participated in multiple projects across different fields (including Deep Learning & Finance, Graph Learning, LLM , Medical Imaging and Audio Analysis) and have several experiences as RA.

After multiple research experiences, I have discovered that I am deeply interested in several areas related to AI, particularly in: **Graph Learning**(Graph Reasoning, Graph Summary, Graph&LLM), **NLP&LLM** (Data Augmentation, RAG, Complex Reasoning, LLM&Graph), **AI4Medicine**(Medical Imaging Analysis, Audio Analysis, etc).

**I would be delighted to connect and collaborate with everyone!**
