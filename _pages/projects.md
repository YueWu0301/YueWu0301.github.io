# Bilibili Analysis
## 2023/10
- Utilized techniques such as **ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and ANCOVA** to **quantify the significant impact of factors** such as tags, gender, video length, and their interactions on the number of followers.

- Conducted variable selection using methods such as **RandomForest, Lasso,XGBoost and HDCSIS** to **identify the most relevant variables** to the number of followers for further analysis.

- Utilized methods such as **weighted least squares,  generalized linear models, and other 5 models** for **regression analysis** and provided **model interpretations**.

- Used **K-medoids** for content creator classification and designed **underestimation mechanism** to identify the most promising and cost-effective categories and video formats. Provided recommendations for content creator positioning.
